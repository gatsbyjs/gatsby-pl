## What constitutes a Gatsby event?

A community-organized Gatsby event can be a local meetup, a small conference, a “lunch and learn” with coworkers, or a larger event - as long as **it includes at least one Gatsby-focused presentation or discussion**. It’s up to you how many people you want to invite and how casual the environment. You can organize an event at your workplace or for the local community.

## What support does Gatsby provide?

There are several ways Gatsby can support your event:

- Promote event on the [Gatsbyjs.org Events Page](/contributing/events/)
- Promote event via [Gatsby’s Twitter account](https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs)
- \$300 off event expenses (food, supplies, space rental, etc.)
- Free Gatsby stickers from the [Gatsby Swag Store](https://store.gatsbyjs.org/)
- 20% off swag in the [Gatsby Swag Store](https://store.gatsbyjs.org/) for your attendees

### A note on shipping

We support US and international Gatsby events, but it’s not uncommon to run into issues with international shipping that can delay orders for weeks. Shipments to non-western countries in particular can often take well over a month to arrive. We’re working on finding international shipping partners, but until that’s sorted out, **if you need stickers shipped internationally, please make sure you’re submitting your event at least 6 weeks in advance**.

## Requirements

- Requests should be made at least 1 month in advance of your event date. (If your event is outside the US and you plan to request stickers, we strongly recommend making your request at least 6 weeks in advance.)
- The event must have at least one Gatsby-focused presentation or discussion.
- Please announce Gatsby as a sponsor for the event and/or list us on the event as a sponsor.
- If you’re requesting the \$300 reimbursement, then you must submit a receipt or receipts for event-related expenses.
- The event must be in harmony with the [Gatsby Code of Conduct](/contributing/code-of-conduct/) and follow the [Gatsby brand guidelines](/guidelines/logo/)
